WebP is a free jpeg replacement from Google. https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/

Advantages:
	Smaller filesizes than Jpeg for any quality;
	Libwebp tools allow easy import of jpegs, resize, crop and recompression;
	File size can be chosen to match SSDV packets;
	Independent blocks limit damage from dropped packets;

Disadvantages:
	Extra processing needed to compress;
	Extra processing needed to decompress and convert back to jpeg;
	Image size needs to be small because single errors cause total failure;
	Fixed block size wastes bandwidth on "empty" blocks.

Strategy:
	Keep it simple;
	Split large image into small WebP sub-images (max 240 bytes);
	Use fixed 48 x 48 pixel images to reduce packet overhead;
	Send each sub-image as a 256-byte SSDV packet;
	Re-assemble image and convert (back) to jpeg.

Command line tools:

	apt-get install libwebp

	cwebp image.jpg -size 230 -pass 3 -crop 0 0 48 48 -o subimage.webp
	ssdv -i 0 -p 0 -c <name> subimage.webp subimage.ssdv
	cat subimage.ssdv >/dev/ttyAMA0

	ssdv -d subimage.ssdv newsubimage.webp
	dwebp -ppm newsubimage.webp -o newsubimage.ppm
